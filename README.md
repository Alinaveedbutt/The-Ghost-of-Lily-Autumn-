# The-Ghost-of-Lily-Autumn-
A C++ text-based mystery game where you play as a detective exploring a haunted house to uncover the truth behind the disappearance of the Autumn family. This project was created during my first semester as a way to practice logic building, user interaction, and narrative branching using C++. It uses a fully procedural structure (functions, conditionals, vectors)
